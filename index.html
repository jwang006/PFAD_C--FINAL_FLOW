                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p align="justify">"Flow" is the relationship between human behavior and the environment. 
                    It is both a path of human behavior and the result of that behavior. 
                    This project uses color tracking to interact with the participants, and create physical trails of movement, and generative 'flow' trails. For now, the "Flow" could be our planet, or perhaps the surface of the moon and Mars in the years ahead.</p>

                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>
                
                <p align="justify">Humans always enjoy disciplining our environment. We specialize in modifying the natural environment, placing it in a way that is adapted to human survivalism and behaviors. 
                    Around the world, we plan roads, regulate planting areas, guide traffic with lights, view the landscape from the plenty of small windows of skyscrapers, and so on. 
                    Even this "hobby" has developed beyond the surface of the planet. (p1&2) Musk's plans for the transformation of Mars were great and futuristic.
                    He envisaged transforming Mars, a desolate, rust-colored planet, into an Earth-like blue planet suitable for life and development. (p3) In <em>Rashomon - The Future</em>, a collaborative book by multiple authors,Cixin Liu emphasizes the importance of transforming the universe in <em>One and One Hundred Thousand Earth</em>.</p>
                
                    <p align="justify">
                        Unlike nature, which is mysterious and disorderly, we are fascinated with control and feel comfortable making sure the environment is in ideal way for us. 
                        Like flowing water, it relies on its environment to change its shape. 
                        The development and survival of the "flow" of civilization in human society is dependent on the earth and nature. 
                        The "flow" is invisible, but at the same time dependent on the "form", is carried by people or objects, has time and space, and changes over time with each frame changes in the three dimensions of space. 
                        In his book <em>The Artistic and Philosophical Practice of the Near Feminine</em>, Hong Wang mentions that "flow" (flow, flux, circulation) is the essence of natural and social development. 
                        Castells M also proposes that flow space is "the material organization of social practices that operate through flow and share time". 
                        This "flow" of space has evolved with the times, and the context always changed with the trails, which has eventually been preserved in some form of material. </p>

                <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
                
                <p align="justify">The impact of human behavior on the environment is inevitable and its trials are well documented, including the construction of cities, as well as the damage to the soil, all of which needs time. 
                    This work is based on the character of "flow", both time and space, to create a time-delayed texture, which is a metaphor for the relationship between the environment and human behavior. 
                    Firstly, the spatiality of 'Flow' is reflected in the movement of particles which is a continuation of the mid-term work <em>Addition == Subtraction></em>. 
                    Looking back midterm presentation, the flowing effect of the ink reflections by occasionally. 
                    This project is an attempt to design flowing particles moving in a 3d domain.
                    The design is referred to codes from Dimitre and Alexandru Margineanu, which increases the speed and force of movement of the particles. 
                    Particles expand and regroup in force and velocity resulting from the distance between lights, and then creating a repeated contraction and expansion like a flow of light.
                </p>
                        
                <p align="justify">Secondly, the time of the "flow" is reflected in the material. As Kyra Schmidt demonstrates in her <em>Transcriptions</em>, the environment is visual, material, and temporal. 
                    In her work, the colors change through the seasons, from sunrise to sunset. That inspired me to use UV-changed paper to display these trails. 
                    Also, I need to think about how to show those traces and behaviors at the same time.</p>
            </section> 

            <section>
                <h3>Reflection and Future Development</h3>
                
                <p align="justify">The pop-up was successful and I appreciate those compliments. 
                    Through the interaction with the UV light and paper, the viewer successfully noticed the traces of the flow and questioned how it works with their movement, which is the key and purpose of this project.
                    What's more, time is perhaps the next stage I need to update. Chinese sculptor Jianguo Sui, in his<em>The Shape of Time</em>, visualizes time. 
                    Sam Lavigne's <em>Unwhorl</em> gives snails the power to be musicians, which is interesting.
                    I believe that the trials of behavior should be permanently and enriched variably over time. 
                    It could be either gradually growing paint or a translation of the snail's behavior. 
                    Besides, informative cues of the project need to be improved too during the exhibition. 
                    Some viewers did not how to interact with my project without my explanation.
